## Notes

### Central Questions
* Using the metaphor of the mirror, Taylor interrogates the role of the library as a reflection of culture. What role do libraries play in canonization of certain works and figures?
* Uses documentation of the Downtown New York scene as an example of the ways that collecting contemporary materials can complicate our understanding of collecting and the ways that libraries "authorize" collected materials
* Questions whether our collections can truly reflect a culture. Do the materials we collect actually tell the stories we expect them to tell? 
* Notes the tension between the Downtown scene culture of challenging societal structures complicates the notion of collecting said scene within the societal structures of a library; particularly the ways that libraries organize and describe materials

### Downtown Scene overview
* Beginning in the 1970s, a wide variety of artists with a wide variety of influences began to create work that challenged the traditional categories of art
* An "insurgency" against the traditional art scene and its close relationship with cultural institutions
* Not a clearly defined movement or genre, but a postmodern approach to leveraging art to criticize structural inequality, including that inherent in traditional art scene

### Challenges in classifying Downtown works
* Downtown works do not fit neatly into traditional classification schemes
* Gives several examples (a few summarized below)
    * David Wojnarowicz's writing often classified under AIDS, but he wrote about a lot more, and personally attempted to have his work moved into "general literature" in bookstores, acting against attempts to define him by his disease
    * *Maus* is classed as a work of history in LC, rather than art or literature, despite the fact that it is a work of graphic fiction

### Taylor's approaches to the Downtown collection
* Papers of Ron Kolm included large amount of printed material about downtown writing, most of which was not already cataloged in OCLC. Fear that this material would get buried in the catalog, since it is so isolated. Created special heading for the material to help raise its visibility for researchers.
* Also in Kolm papers: announcements about artist events, which are especially valuable for reconstructing the Downtown scene as it unfolded. Chose to organize these by person (if one artist) or place (if more), making them far more usable than if they were simply kept as an ephemera series with limited organization

### What does this mean for the library?
* Taylor notes that most Downtown writing was circulated outside of traditional publishing networks. Therefore, it was usually excluded from library collections, which rely on these networks to make collection development decisions. 
* In collecting these materials, usually excluded from libraries, and seeing how they defy library classification and descriptive methods, Taylor realized that libraries are major players in constructing a normalizing cultural discourse, "constraining the individual," defining movements, and validating publishers' choices
* Taylor relates his argument to Foucault, positioning the library as another stream of cultural discourse. He uses his experience with the Downtown scene to challenge Foucault's assertion that the archive can only reflect the "historical *a priori*" of cultural discourse. He believes the archive can include outsider cultural voices if deliberately so constructed.
* Advocates for collecting the totality of a culture, collecting in such a way that documents the relationships between people, works, and events as they were happening, rather than focusing collecting on those few artists who became famous and now represent the Downtown scene in broader cultural discourse
* Notes that this approach is complicated because in collecting in this way, he is positing that something called the Downtown Scene existed, and also defining its borders in his collecting choices. Believes that the risks created by this problem can be mitigated by critical understanding of the cultural processes of collecting and their role in constructing cultural discourse

## Thoughts
What interests me about this approach is that, though Taylor does not explicitly acknowledge it, his approach to collecting and describing the Downtown Scene blends the professional disciplinary approaches of archivists and librarians. He is creating an "artificial" subject collection and positioning himself in the role of curator, a traditional library approach to collecting. But, he is also using the techniques of documentation strategy, which developed in the archival community, where collecting the records of "lesser" cultural figures is far more common and less controversial. His choices to subvert traditional methods of arrangement and description for the Downtown collection represent an example of the potential created when librarians and archivists work together, consider the full spectrum of arrangement and descriptive techniques available, and choose those most suited to anticipated use, rather than following formulaic rules for cataloging or processing.

Taylor does not say much about his individual role in building this collection. I'm thinking about the relationships and knowledge that a curator must develop in order to attempt to hold a mirror up to any culture. I assume that Taylor is, at some level, participating in this culture as an invdividual actor as well as an institutional actor. How does that impact his work? What would the collection look like if it were built by someone else?
